Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. These systems improve over time without being explicitly programmed. The core types of machine learning include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning uses labeled data, while unsupervised learning works on unlabeled data to find hidden patterns. Reinforcement learning is based on rewards and punishments as signals for positive and negative behavior. Applications include image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and predictive analytics.

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. These systems improve over time without being explicitly programmed. The core types of machine learning include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning uses labeled data, while unsupervised learning works on unlabeled data to find hidden patterns.
